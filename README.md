# Next.js Learning Project

Welcome to my Next.js learning journey! This project serves as a hands-on playground for exploring modern web development with Next.js and related technologies.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15.3.5** - The React framework for production
- **React 19** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Axios** - Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- **ESLint** - For code linting and maintaining code quality

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `/app` - Contains all the application pages and routes
  - `/about` - About page component
  - `/contact-us` - Contact page component
- `/public` - Static files (images, icons, etc.)
- `/Components` - Reusable React components
  - `/navbar` - Navigation bar component

## 📝 Notes

This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in modern web development. I'm continuously updating and improving it as I learn new concepts and best practices.

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear them!

Happy coding! 👨‍💻

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
